/**
 * Adds a custom word to a custom language model.
 *
 * Adds a custom word to a custom language model. The service populates the words resource for a custom model with out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words found in each corpus added to the model. You can use this method to add additional words or to modify existing words in the words resource. You must use credentials for the instance of the service that owns a model to add or modify a custom word for the model. Adding or modifying a custom word does not affect the custom model until you train the model for the new data by using the `POST /v1/customizations/{customization_id}/train` method.   Use the `word_name` path parameter to specify the custom word that is to be added or modified. Use the `CustomWord` object to provide one or both of the optional `sounds_like` and `display_as` fields for the word. * The `sounds_like` field provides an array of one or more pronunciations for the word. Use the parameter to specify how the word can be pronounced by users. Use the parameter for words that are difficult to pronounce, foreign words, acronyms, and so on. For example, you might specify that the word `IEEE` can sound like `i triple e`. You can specify a maximum of five sounds-like pronunciations for a word. For information about pronunciation rules, see [Using the sounds_like field](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/services/speech-to-text/language-resource.html#soundsLike). * The `display_as` field provides a different way of spelling the word in a transcript. Use the parameter when you want the word to appear different from its usual representation or from its spelling in corpora training data. For example, you might indicate that the word `IBM(trademark)` is to be displayed as `IBM`. For more information, see [Using the display_as field](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/services/speech-to-text/language-resource.html#displayAs).    If you add a custom word that already exists in the words resource for the custom model, the new definition overwrites the existing data for the word. If the service encounters an error, it does not add the word to the words resource. Use the `GET /v1/customizations/{customization_id}/words/{word_name}` method to review the word that you add.
 *
 * @param {Object} params - The parameters to send to the service.
 * @param {string} [params.username] - required unless use_unauthenticated is set.
 * @param {string} [params.password] - required unless use_unauthenticated is set.
 * @param {Object} [params.headers]
 * @param {boolean} [params.headers.X-Watson-Learning-Opt-Out=false] - opt-out of data collection
 * @param {string} [params.url] - override default service base url
 * @param {string} params.customization_id - The GUID of the custom language model to which a word is to be added. You must make the request with service credentials created for the instance of the service that owns the custom model.
 * @param {string} params.word_name - The custom word that is to be added to or updated in the custom model. Do not include spaces in the word. Use a - (dash) or _ (underscore) to connect the tokens of compound words.
 * @param {string} params.content_type - The type of the input.
 * @param {string} [params.word] - **When specifying an array of one or more words,** you must specify the custom word that is to be added to or updated in the custom model. Do not include spaces in the word. Use a - (dash) or _ (underscore) to connect the tokens of compound words. **When adding or updating a single word directly,** omit this field.
 * @param {string[]} [params.sounds_like] - An array of sounds-like pronunciations for the custom word. Specify how words that are difficult to pronounce, foreign words, acronyms, and so on can be pronounced by users. For a word that is not in the service's base vocabulary, omit the parameter to have the service automatically generate a sounds-like pronunciation for the word. For a word that is in the service's base vocabulary, use the parameter to specify additional pronunciations for the word. You cannot override the default pronunciation of a word; pronunciations you add augment the pronunciation from the base vocabulary. A word can have at most five sounds-like pronunciations, and a pronunciation can include at most 40 characters not including spaces.
 * @param {string} [params.display_as] - An alternative spelling for the custom word when it appears in a transcript. Use the parameter when you want the word to have a spelling that is different from its usual representation or from its spelling in corpora training data.
 * @return {Promise} - The Promise that the action returns.
